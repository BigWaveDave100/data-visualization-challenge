1. Starting off, we import the dependencies, read and merge the mouse and study data. 
2. Clean the data 
3. We then summarize the date for each drug regimen by getting the mean, median, variance, standard variation, and the SEM value.
4. We determine the total number of mice subjected to each of the regimens and created bar plot.
5. Using a pie chart, we determined the distribution of male to female mice used in the study 
6. Narrowing down the study, we look into 4 of the drug regimens and determine the outliers that do not support the overall study. 
7. After creating a box plot, it does appear that the Ramicane and the Capomulin treatments were the most effective. 
8. Looking specifically into the Capomulin regimen, we can show with a line graph the reduction of the a tumor size over time of a specific mouse (l509)
9. Using a scatter plot we look into the Capomulin regimen for the weight of the mice vs. the tumor size to determine the correlation between the two vlaues. Using linear regression to determine the accuracy of the correlation beween the two values. 
10. Based on the study it is accurate to assume, in the case of Capomulin, that the weight of the mouse and the size of the tumor are correlated and the treatment does work in reducing the tumor size over time.
